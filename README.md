# BME-i9400
## Special Topics in Machine Learning

This is the public web home of **BME i9400: Special Topics in Machine Learning**, a 14-week course being delivered to graduate engineering students at the [City College of New York's Biomedical Engineering Department](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/bme). 

The objective of the course is to provide students with foundational theoretical knowledge of statistical learning, and hands-on, practical experience with implementing learning algorithms in Python.

*All course material is being made available here in case that other students and instructors may find them to be useful*
