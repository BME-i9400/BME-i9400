# BME-i9400
## Special Topics in Machine Learning

This is the public web home of _BME i9400: Special Topics in Machine Learning, a 14-week course being delivered to graudate engineering students at the [City College of New York's Biomedical Engineering Department](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/bme). 
The objective of the course is to provide students with the principles of computer software as well as hands-on, practical experience with composing high-level code with modern-day, cloud-based tools. 

_All course material is being made available here in case that other students and instructors may find them to be useful_
