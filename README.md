### Course Description
This graduate-level course provides hands-on experience with machine learning techniques applied to biomedical engineering problems. Students will master fundamental ML concepts, implement neural networks and transformers, work with multimodal biomedical data, and critically evaluate AI systems for healthcare applications. The course emphasizes practical implementation through interactive coding sessions using Python and modern ML frameworks.
The use of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) is permitted and encouraged; however, students must validate and critically interpret AI-generated outputs. The course culminates in a capstone project where students apply learned techniques to a biomedical problem of their choice.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. **Formulate** biomedical problems as regression/classification tasks and choose suitable models
2. **Train** models via gradient-based optimization; understand losses, regularization, and evaluation
3. **Implement** and **analyze** CNNs, sequence models, and transformer-based LLM workflows
4. **Integrate** text, images, and time-series in simplified multimodal pipelines
5. **Critically evaluate** fairness, explainability, privacy, and deployment constraints in biomedicine
6. **Deliver** a reproducible mini-project with appropriate metrics, visualizations, and limitations

### Prerequisites
- Linear algebra and probability/statistics foundation
- Basic Python programming experience
- No prior ML experience required

### Required Technology
- Laptop with web browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
- GitHub account for accessing course materials
- JupyterHub access (provided on first day)
