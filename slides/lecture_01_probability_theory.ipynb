A new test has been developed to detect the virus. The test has a 10% false positive rate, meaning that if a patient is negative, there is a 10% chance that the test result will indicate infection. The test also has a 10% false negative rate, meaning that if a patient is positive, there is a 10% chance that the test result will indicate no infection. \n",
