    "\n",
    "In the Monty Hall game show, there are 3 doors. Behind one door is a Tesla Cybertruck, and behind the other two doors are goats. The objective is to choose the door with the Cybertruck. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are 3 doors: A, B, and C.\n",
    "- Behind one door is the Cybertruck (let's say Door A), and behind the other two doors are goats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing a Door\n",
    "\n",
    "You randomly choose one door. Let's consider the possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case 1**: You choose Door A (the door with the Cybertruck).\n",
    "- **Case 2**: You choose Door B (a door with a goat).\n",
    "- **Case 3**: You choose Door C (a door with a goat).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monty Reveals a Goat\n",
    "\n",
    "Monty Hall, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the other two doors that has a goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you initially picked Door A, Monty can open either Door B or Door C (both have goats).\n",
    "- If you initially picked Door B, Monty will open Door C (the only door left with a goat).\n",
    "- If you initially picked Door C, Monty will open Door B (the only door left with a goat).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. \\( P({win a Cybertruck | switch your guess}) \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you **switch** your guess, the outcomes are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you originally chose Door A (with the Cybertruck): Monty opens one of the other two doors, showing a goat. Switching will result in choosing one of the two doors with a goat, so you lose.\n",
    "- If you chose Door B (a goat): Monty opens Door C (the other goat), and switching to Door A will win you the Cybertruck.\n",
    "- If you chose Door C (a goat): Monty opens Door B (the other goat), and switching to Door A will win you the Cybertruck.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you **do not switch** your guess:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you originally chose Door A (the Cybertruck), you win.\n",
    "- If you chose Door B (a goat), you lose.\n",
    "- If you chose Door C (a goat), you lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the probabilities derived:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( P({win | switch}) = 2/3 \\)\n",
    "- \\( P({win | do not switch}) = 1/3 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since \\( 2/3 > 1/3 \\), you should **definitely switch your guess** to maximize your chances of winning the Tesla Cybertruck!\n"

We will run the simulation 10,000 times for each strategy and count how many times we win the Tesla Cybertruck.
