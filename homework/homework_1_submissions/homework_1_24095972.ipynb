    "You are a contestant on a game show hosted by Monty Hall. In the game show, there are 3 doors. Behind one of the doors is a Tesla Cybertruck. Behind the other two is a goat (i.e., opening each of the other two doors reveals a goat). The object of the game is to successfully choose the door holding the Tesla Cybertruck -- regardless of how much you may love goats or dislike Tesla Cybertrucks. \n",
    " \n",
    "Now imagine that you randomly choose one of the doors. Mr. Hall then shows you one of the other two doors, revealing a goat. He then offers you the chance to switch your initial guess.\n",
